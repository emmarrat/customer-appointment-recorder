# Customers appointment recorder


## Motivation: 

- to create a simple web application to book experts, with a view of available dates and times
- to provide an easy way to view the records and regulate them as well as the experts by the administrator
- to create a project that can be reused. This project can easily be used for any other services (beauty, medicine, dentistry, etc.), the project is set up so that for reuse you can only update the theme and static files.
